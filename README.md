# CAN-Based-Body-Control-Module
Designed and developed a prototype Body Control Module (BCM) for automotive applications using the LPC2129 microcontroller and Embedded C. The system facilitates control of key vehicle functions, including lighting, door locks, and wipers, leveraging the Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol for efficient and reliable in-vehicle communication.
